You have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight and on ranged attack rolls. Magic such as the regenerate spell can restore the lost eye. If you have no eyes left after sustaining this injury, you\u2019re blinded. 2 Lose an Arm or a Hand. You can no longer hold anything with two hands, and you can hold only a single object at a time. Magic such as the regenerate spell can restore the lost appendage. 3 Lose a Foot or Leg. Your speed on foot is halved, and you must use a cane or crutch to move unless you have a peg leg or other prosthesis. You fall prone after using the Dash action. You have disadvantage on Dexterity checks made to balance. Magic such as the regenerate spell can restore the lost appendage. 4 Limp. Your speed on foot is reduced by 5 feet. You must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw after using the Dash action. If you fail the save, you fall prone. Magical healing removes the limp. 5-7 Internal Injury. Whenever you attempt an action in combat, you must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you lose your action and can\u2019t use reactions until the start of your next turn. The injury heals if you receive magical healing or if you spend ten days doing nothing but resting. 8-10 Broken Ribs. This has the same effect as Internal Injury above, except that the save DC is 10. 11-13 Horrible Scar. You are disfigured to the extent that the wound can\u2019t be easily concealed. You have disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks and advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. Magical healing of 6th level or higher, such as heal and regenerate, removes the scar. 14-16 Festering Wound. Your hit point maximum is reduced by 1 every 24 hours the wound persists. If your hit point maximum drops to 0, you die. The wound heals if you receive magical healing. Alternatively, someone can tend to the wound and make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check once every 24 hours. After ten successes, the wound heals. 17-29 Minor Scar. The scar doesn\u2019t have any adverse effect. Magical healing of 6th level or higher, such as heal and regenerate, removes the scar. <p>Source: https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/dungeon-masters-workshop#Injuries</p>"},{"location":"Random%20Tables/Rocks%20Rock/","title":"Rocks Rock","text":"d20 Name Notes 1-3 Granite A common igneous rock that is used extensively in construction. 4-6 Sandstone A sedimentary rock made up of sand-sized grains. 7-8 Limestone A sedimentary rock that is often used as a building material. 9-10 Shale A sedimentary rock that is composed of clay and other fine-grained minerals. 11-12 Basalt A volcanic rock that is often used for decorative purposes. 13-14 Marble A metamorphic rock that is prized for its beauty. 15-16 Gneiss A metamorphic rock that is often used as a building material. 17-18 Quartzite A metamorphic rock that is known for its hardness and durability. 19 Slate A metamorphic rock that is commonly used for roofing and flooring. 20 Tephrite An uncommon volcanic rock often used as an ornamental stone."},{"location":"Random%20Tables/Travel/","title":"Travel","text":"Roll Encounter/Weather 1 Peaceful Travels: The party travels through a calm and serene landscape. 2 Helpful NPCs: The party encounters friendly NPCs who offer them aid or information. 3 Harsh Weather: The party must endure difficult weather conditions such as heavy rain, snow, or extreme heat. 4 Mysterious Site: The party comes across a strange and mysterious location, such as an ancient ruin or a mystical portal. 5 Animal Encounter: The party encounters a group of wild animals, such as wolves or bears. 6 Bandit Attack: The party is ambushed by a group of bandits looking to rob them. 7 Friendly Settlement: The party arrives at a friendly settlement where they can rest and resupply. 8 Hostile Settlement: The party encounters a settlement where the locals are suspicious or hostile towards outsiders. 9 Strange Phenomenon: The party witnesses a strange and unusual phenomenon, such as a meteor shower or an aurora. 10 Tricky Terrain: The party must navigate difficult terrain, such as a dense forest or a treacherous mountain pass. 11 Combat Encounter: The party is attacked by hostile creatures or monsters (easy). 12 Combat Encounter: The party is attacked by hostile creatures or monsters (hard)."},{"location":"Random%20Tables/Wilderness%20Terrain/","title":"Wilderness Terrain","text":"<p>Remember any Terrain should be mapped and similar when the players return. | Roll | Terrain Feature | | ---- | --------------- | | 1    | Dense Forest | | 2    | Rocky Terrain | | 3    | Hills and Valleys | | 4    | Mountain Pass | | 5    | River or Stream | | 6    | Swamp or Bog | | 7    | Desert or Dunes | | 8    | Tundra or Permafrost | | 9    | Coastal Cliffside | | 10   | Cavern or Cave System | | 11-12| Unique Terrain: the DM can choose or roll for a unique or unusual terrain feature. |</p>"},{"location":"Session%20Notes/Session%2000/","title":"Session 00","text":"<ul> <li>Created new characters</li> <li>Create a bond between a player 1d6 away from you at the table.</li> <li>Discussed Lines and Veils (hard don'ts and OK offscreen) - See index.</li> </ul> <p>Campaign start.</p> <p>Players took a job to protect and transport a wagon of goods on route to its destination.</p> <p>On route, in the middle of a slightly forested area, the wagon was ambushed by a number of goblin.

One Goblin nearly escapes, riding a goat off into the forest, stopped by Skcorsy as it parses the Tavern.</p> <p>Then the fight is interrupted by the hum, it's sound growing louder.
