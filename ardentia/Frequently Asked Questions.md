## General

#### Player Agency

We all need to be somewhat comfortable with our player agency being removed due to different DM styles. Hopefully the structure of the campaign (specifically the end of session debreif) will help protect this 

#### World building

All world building is done by GMs and players during and preparing for sessions.
This is a new unique realm and doesn't require any pre-existing knowledge of the Forgotten Realms (etc) to understand. Stealing good ideas from other worlds is encouraged.

#### What happens on a TPK?

Roll new characters.
The DM's character dies too.

#### Almost Death

If you are downed during combat and rolling death saves you have to roll on the [Lingering Injuries] table.
One roll on the table each time you are downed (not per death save roll).

#### Inspiration

Two players will be awarded inspriation at the end of the game as a reward for good RP.
This will be determined by group vote.

## Character Creation

#### What level do characters start at?
Back to level 1 (or maybe 3?)
What if there is a huge level discrepancy?

#### Custom character origins?
Instead of the default ability modifiers based on race, you can **instead** increase one ability by two and another by one.  (if you want to)

#### Duplicate proficiencies 
Pick a free profenciency

#### Leveling up and Hit Points
We will be rolling for hit points as we level up.
Re-roll if you roll a 1.

## In Game

#### Brutal Crits
When rolling a natural 20 on an attack: 
* Apply a full die of damage and add your damage roll as normal.

Brutal Crits apply for spells as well.

#### Brutal Fails
Encouraged and at GMs discression.

#### Flanking in Combat
* If at least two players are directly on opposite sides of an enemy you are attacking then you attack with advantage.
	* The both players have to threaten the enemy. i.e. a stealthed player could not grant you advantage.

#### Meets it Beats it
If your roll meets a check, you pass
