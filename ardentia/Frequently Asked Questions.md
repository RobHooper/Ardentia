#### World building

All world building is done by GMs and players during and preparing for sessions.
This is a new unique realm and doesn't require any pre-existing knowledge of the Forgotten Realms (etc) to understand. Stealing good ideas from other worlds is encouraged.

#### What happens on a TPK?

Roll new characters (?)

#### What level do characters start at?

Back to level 1 (or maybe 3?)
What if there is a huge level discrepancy?

#### Custom character origins?

Instead of the default ability modifiers based on race, you can **instead** increase one ability by two and another by one.  (?)

#### Leveling up and Hit Points

We will be rolling for hit points as we level up.
Re-roll if you roll a 1 (?)

#### Almost Death

If you are downed during combat and rolling death saves you have to roll on the [Lingering Injuries] table. 

#### Inspiration

Two players will be awarded inspriation at the end of the game as a reward for good RP.
This will be determined by group vote.
