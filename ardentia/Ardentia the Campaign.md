## The Rules
* You are an adventurer because you feel a strong call in your bones to adventure. The boredom of a calm life doesn't appeal to you – you are driven to leave behind the safety of civilization and explore the wilds to make your name. Regardless of what drives you, you are driven. You choose where to go and what to do. There will be a handful of obvious choices, but you don't by any means need to take them. The adventure is in your hands.
* Adventures start and finish in [[The Tavern]] (unless otherwise specified).

### House Rules
* "Meets it beats it"
* Have fun.
* Avoid child death
