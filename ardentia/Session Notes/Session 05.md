In the last week...

* Chez - Doesn't like spiders. Gets as much bed rest as possible.
* Sedalb - Enjoys poetry
* Smokey - Incorrectly installed a bell on the tavern door
* Alder - Claims herself mayor of the town and provisions an office in one of the abandoned buildings.


Short snouted boy enters the tavern holding a missing person poster, we check it and see the face of Huff...
We quickly hire the boy to run errands for us.

Fi - Rosie & Lavender 

Pink envelope, pink hawk
From sweetkins, deputy mayor

We enter the shed and are greeted by a busy bar, at the bar we meet a cute pixie who turns out to be sweetkins.

In one corner there is a red table full of goblins.

Another corner, a yellow table where fi and an interesting character sit

Sweetkins makes a big drink, candy floss and pink.
She doesn't like men.
We ask for a manly whisky, she pulls a dirty whisky bottle from under the bar and poors for Smokey, he splutters as it tastes of dust in his mouth.

Fi is comfortable with the stranger. They are made of moss, wood and leaves. A warforged locomotive. With a self contained ecosystem.

Slab sites on the chair at the green table and the chair starts sinking.
He jumps off of it.

While investigating the shed, Fi met Luna (the warforged) who invited her in and welcomed her.

---

A bell rings and everyone jumps up and heads to the green table, sitting on the chairs they all sink down. Due to a lack of seats Chez sits on Fi.
The chairs sink into an empty room.
A dirty room
Heaven / Hell themed room.

Dave approaches, vibrating holding a can of energy drink.
He takes bets.
30gp for Smokey to win.
30gp on Alder to win

Woddles enters the arena and explodes.

Fi + Alder enter and fight a giant goat and an orc.

5v5 goblins 
We make a 5gp bet last minute
Everyone who died exploded.

Chez and Selab vs seahags x2, goat and elk.
Selab tragically dies during the fight, Chez inherits his robe.

Invited back for the BYOM (bring your own monster) night.
