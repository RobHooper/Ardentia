A month has passed...

* Smokey studies and creates a molotov cocktail, 9 goats are burnt in the process but he makes 5 molotovs.
* Alter and the deputy are working on putting stonebrook on the map.
	* They open an admin office and trade hub
* Chez invents the camera, it isn't perfect but catches a shadow'y imprint. He is also gaining reputation in the daily bugbear as a writer.
* Luna - Is provisioning bacon, Greenifying the town
* Fi - Farming fightclub for XP

A gnome enters wearing a green hat and formal wear.

"It's time to pay your taxes"

We explain we've had issues collecting taxes but lets go try together.

"I know", says Chez "we'll check out the Goblin cave"

---

Entering the cave it looks like it has housed a ritualistic killing.

We go further down the cave but cannot see the dragon, Chez lights his torch angering the dragon tracking us from the ceiling. 

Fire breaths down on us knocking Alder and Chez nearly unconscious.
The tax man dies immediately. 

Fighting the party claws their way out, nearly all being down at some point.
We talk the dragon into a moment of peace and slowly pull Smokey out who had been in the dragons mouth and downed while saving us others.

---

Escaping the cave the party find themselves seriously injured, healing sources expended. 

Slowly making way back to the Tavern we see a suspicious abandoned wagon ahead, Smokey approaches and throws a molitov, they are all broken in his bag and he falls to the floor bleeding out.
He dies, his last words are "Don't worry guys I'll be back in 20 seconds".

We setup to short rest rather than continuing. The bandits approach but we talk them into not fightring.

Reaching the tavern inside we meet another gnome who suggests playing a Jigsaw puzzle so we continued for the rest of the evening.
