In the last week...
* Jorm - helped others move in, working with Skcorsy to build a Goat Pen.
* Fi - Found a shed but it was making a mysterious sound so she avoided it.
* Chaz - Fixed the Tavern roof.
* Smokey - Scavenging and provisioning parts to build a Gambling Den.
* Skcorsy - Built a separate Goat Pen to Jorm.
* Alder - Improves the Tavern Garden area.

The Tavern is being provisioned assuming 1/3rd of the clientele are Halflings (since that matches the party composition).

A couple of us awake late at night notice a comet flying through the night sky. Followed by the "early birds" finding a purple sky as we woke. We also all noticed a strange humming sound.

A clatter came from the barn where Skcorsy's goats are staying, a few of us go to investigate, some lagging behind due to the early hour.

Goblins are raiding the barn, trying to steal our goats.
Most of us jump into action and charge at the goblins fending them off.
One Goblin nearly escapes, riding a goat off into the forest, stopped by Skcorsy as it parses the Tavern.

Then the fight is interrupted by the hum, it's sound growing louder.
The goblins and us look to the sky where we see a large meteor crashing to our north east.
During this time Alder picks off the distracted goblins, and any remaining foes scatter.

* ***Level Up***

We have a sense that the meteor was carrying something interesting and that we need to act quick before it's energy dissipates, so we set off.

Leaving Jorm in charge we set off.

Heading north east, we follow the road leading towards forest.
En-route a friendly crow fly's overhead, almost leading our party in a sense. 
The nature of the crow causes conflict between some of the party.

Travelling as far as we can, we make camp for the day. 
During the night the camp gets attacked by a Ghast and a number of large rats.
Fending off the fight, we go back to sleep.

In the morning we continue on, following the road as the forest gets denser around us.

Unaware of the traps around us, Fi falls down a hole, caught in spiders web she fights to break free.
At this moment a number of wolf spiders descend on the party from the treetops, and in the pit phase spider materialises.
Fi leaps out of the pit with ease and without help.
Skcor however barely survives the fight, being knocked unconscious, without an eye and with two broken ribs.

Still undeterred, the party rest for the night before continuing the last leg of the journey.
Taking the direct mountain path, we leave the road.

Encountering minor issues and taking a few scrapes we can see the crater on the other side of a river.
Fi leaps over the river taking a rope with her. Slowly and carefully the party traverse the strong current. Some tightrope walking over staying dry and others cautiously wading through.

Looking over the craters edge we find a number of people at the meteor, goblins equipped with pickaxes swinging at the stone, a larger hobgoblin and a horned tiefling.

Charging into combat upon two goats, we surprise the creatures quickly leading to victory.

In the rock and upon the monsters person, we each find a glowing stone and the sense of a magical power coming from inside them.
