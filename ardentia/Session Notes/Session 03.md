Since last week...

* Fi - Entered the shed, using her new spell polymorph she turned into a mouse and explored it.
* Chaz - Started planning the opening party for the Tavern and therefore started a small newspaper in town called [[The Daily Bugbear]] . Hoping to get good Michelin reviews in soon.
* Jorm - Completed his Yurt and made a pipe to smoke.
* Alder - Started Campaigning for Mayor
	* "Don't get eaten by a bear, vote Alder for Mayor!"
* Smokey - Found a new friend, a goblin called Gerry. They've started playing dice and gambling, Smokey's debt is currently unknown.
* Skcorsy - Practicing his magic tricks to impress Gerry, but he was not impressed.


Skcorsy has received an invitation to speak at a the annual Rock Co. Rock conference along with a number of +1s to bring all of us and a few goats.

We all set off leaving Gerry and the other goats in charge.

Skcorsy takes the group along the road and then stops in the middle of a field. As we're wondering what is going on an airship appears docking in front of us.

A goblin greets us, "Hello I am wobbles the first mate, welcome to the orbital express."

As we climb aboard we make our way to the self service mar and the boat takes off.
This is going to be a 2 day trip to the city.

Skcorsy settles in at the bar/lounge.

Talking to the goblin we find out he has been with the company for ~6.89 years.

We then great the Captain, Captain Windston Amber beard, he has been flying to 170 years. A Dwarf with a large beard and dark hair.
After standing in the bridge for a while it is time to go to sleep.

---

Early the next morning we are woken by a hurried knock at the door, "Come quick, Skcorsy has been killed".

As we enter his room we find his body laying flat on the bead with a large mushy hole in his chest.
It is a long hole with open ventricles. 

Smokey retreats.

The captain commissions us to find his murderer, but we have to work with Wobbles. Wobbles was appointed as Deputy of the ship a while ago and is keen to help.

First we check our own weapons for blood, there is none.

Smokey runs to the engine room.
Entering the room it is hard to breath through the smoke.

Jorm reads magic outlawed poster on the wall. The Ship is subject to the laws of the country it is landing in.

Start by interviewing Betty, the goat Skcorsy bought with us.
He went to bed late after staying up drinking.
He also took another goat back to bed with him.

We send Wobbles to fetch the next interviewee and to meet us in the disabled room which we will turn into a private study.

*Interview*: Matilda.
Matilda lost her daughter, Agnes, a few years ago.
Agnes disappeared while on a walk with her husband one day.
Noted: Verbally and Physically attacked. 

Skcorsival was married to Agnes.

*Interview*: Maximillian 

- He is a seller of "items"
- Spoke to Skorsival in the lounge 
- He is going to the Rock conference, he doesn't care about rocks but it is profitable.
- He holds no weapons on him
- We take his card as we may need him to help stock the tavern later.

Investigate Fi who was being suspicious.

*Interview*: Sir Guain

- Old, battled, moustached
- Noble knight of mythrolis 
- Retired
- At ease in the lounge
- Early bed

We then identified that the wound matched the shape of a letter opener.
- Could not be Betsy
- Overheard Elvira

*Interview*: Talin

Talin is an elf, wearing half moon glasses, she is a day dreamer.
We take her handbook and examine it, it is full of botanist notes.
Talin worked with Skorsival years ago, they analysed rocks together.
Specifically looking at rocks with levels under biomes.

Smokey looks and cannot find a letter opener in the room.

Oliver, enters the room, he was waiting outside ready to be interviewed.

- He has been working for Sir Guain for 27 Months
- The previous squire died
- He wants to be big and strong
- He had never met Scorsival.
- Is a child

We then commissioned Oliver to find the letter opener..

*Interview*: Lyra

- Lyra is a scantily clad elven woman.
- Singer
- Plays violin
- May have sold men in the past

*Interview*: Captain Windston

- Does not sell women
- Does not like rocks
- Calles them Losers and Co.
- There should only be 1 Goat onboard
- He was steering the ship until early morning when Wobbles took over.
- No-one can confirm this.

My notes are a bit hazy but, Fi murdered Betsy unprompted.

*Interview*: Wobbles

- Traffics Women
- Is a woman
- Less excided to investigate now.

Oliver appears again, he has found the letter opener, it was in his desk.

He saw an old lady walking out of Skcorsy's Room.

We hatch a plan:
* Announce that magic is lawful thanks to international waters
* Fake revivifying Skorsy.
* Watch to see who might be the culprit.

The passengers react:
* Matilda is annoyed
* Sir Guain touches his moustache
* Elra stops writing for a moment 

We talk to Pippa. She noted that the ship was flying stable throughout the night, this corroborates  with the captains story, he is the only one who is able to fly the ship straight. It was clear when Wobbles took over...

We also noted that Talia has no finger nails nor toe nails. Weird. 

With the pieces in place, we set a trap in Skcorsys room and step back.

Alarm! Fi's bird Ona alerts us someone has entered his room.
We burst into the room and find Talia stuck in Chez's hunters trap, dagger in her pocket.
Seeing us she flees. Transforming into a fly. 

A fight starts.
Talking telepathically, she states she was jealous of Skcorsy's liberal use of magic.
We catch her under a sauce pan.
She escapes and transforms into a minotaur, charging out of the window.

Falling through the air we take swings at her.

Trying to convince Alder to swap sides she offers Alder safety from the fall.

Nearing the ground, Fi transforms into a bird herself grabbing Chez and Alder from death.

Jorm holds onto Talia letting out a short cry of surprise as she transforms into a butterfly leaving him to his fate. Street Pizza.

Seeing her getting away, Chez jumps off of Fi's eagle talon.
Holding his lance in both hands he guides it straight into the butterfly, critical hit.
Crunch a large grey shapeling lays dead on the ground.

Chez feels a pain, his left foot has broken.

Alter searches the scene for bolts.

---

We reconvene back on the ship. 
Taking Skcorsy's body we send it off of the ship in a traditional airship funeral.

The captain rewards us for our with with a magnifying glass of true sight.

Reaching the rock conference, we read Skcorsy's prepared speech

> No security, like the family we found along the way.

Returning to [[On the Rocks]] we find the pub empty, of both visitors and drink. We should have left someone in charge rather than just two goats in a large coat..
