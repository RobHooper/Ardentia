Chez's Patron is France.

A broad paladin enters [[On the Rocks]], enter Sir Percival Huffington.
Welcome to the yurt room.

Enter Selab, a retired high elf warrior.

Chez has been given a tip off from [[The Daily Bugbear]] that goblins are gathering in a near-by cave, he needs help getting the scoop for a new article he is writing.
He disappears upstairs to get his investigator hat, but returning downstairs again he finds everyone has already left...

---

The session started at a cave entrance. 

Huff smells the air, there are Goblins inside.
Sedalb lights a candle.

Entering the cave the party shout.

The goblins respond.
Go away.

The party continue and approach the goblins.

He is looking for a halfling, have they seen any? he holds out a wanted poster.
The goblins have not.

Alder however notices that the poster looks like Smokey.

A nervous accidentally shoots an arrow, it ends in Huffs arm.
He shouts for them to come down from their spot, but intimidated the Gobin is frozen.

Smokey appears late, Alter trys to push him out of the room.
"What have you been doing?! someone is here looking for you!"

The party continue towards the back room in two half's.
Sedalb and Huff going first they notice that the backroom turns into a tunnel which spirals down further into the cave.

The party proceed down the stairs.

Before them they see a large red dragon positioned next to a small stream.
Sedalb successfully sneaks past it.
Smokey searches for loose scales on the floor, he makes some noise but is successful in finding some.
Alter trips waking the dragon, it breathes fire into the air illuminating the room.

Fight.

Or flight for Alder and Sedalb.

After a few moments of heated combat, knocking Huff unconscious, the dragon picks up Smokey and carries him off.

Huff is revived by the others.

Behind the dragon's lair they find a horde of treasure.
Picking up a Robe of Stars (Sedalb), mysterious cube (Alder), and gold the party continue following the stream finding the exit. 

Quickly, they head back to the tavern.

---

As the party enter the tavern they find Smokey sat at the bar. "How?!"

Alder reaches into her bag and finds it is wet, not only that but there is worm inside.

After some discussion about how Smokey could have survived. "ding" the door opens and Skorsy enters.
He definitely died, "How?!"

Alder appears on the stairs, wait there are two Alders?

This is confusing, the barman (Chez) leaves.

...

The party mark the second Alder to avoid confusion.

The discussion doesn't last long however, Smokey stabs Alder, retreating to the stairs Smokey tries to find cover but instead feels an arrow in his back from Alder.

Smokey dies there on the floor, before turning into a worm.
Huff investigates the worm.

Sedalb counts how many people are in the room: Alder, Alder Marked, Persivald (Huff), Sedalb, Sedalb, Skorsy.

Wait two Sedalb's ?!

----

Smokey awakes in the Goblin cave with the dragon.

Fire and blood stain the walls.

Before the dragon can react, he sprints back down the stairs.

He finds a potion in the treasure room and then leaves the cave.

----

Back in the tavern, Seldab shoots a magic missile at everyone - including each worm.

The worm in Huff's hands explodes in grey ooze. 

The worm in Alder's hand explodes in a pink splat (clearly just an earth worm)

A fight breaks out.

Sedalb's doppelganger dies in the tavern in the mess. 

Marked Alder runs upstairs chased by the other Alder.

After checking each room she finds her on the balcony.

Huff runs up to help but is struck by Marked Alder's arrow, he falls to the floor - dead.

Marked Alder leaps over the railing but is shot before she can escape.

Hunting for the remaining doppelgangers Seldab and Alder run outside, there he sees Skorsy escaping on a goat.
Alder shoots a 120ft shot knocking Skorsy off of the goat and dead onto the floor.
