Campaign start.

Players took a job to protect and transport a wagon of goods on route to its destination.

On route, in the middle of a slightly forested area, the wagon was ambushed by a number of goblin.
A large log rolled down the hill and damaged the cart.
The players saw the ambush coming from a mile away and quickly moved out of the way.
The players fought off the goblins with ease.
They fixed the cart by installing the spare wheel as well as bandaging the broken wheel.

Continuing to travel north the players reached the village and tavern where the goods were being taken.
They find the village empty and the tavern damaged, specifically finding three large bolders that crashed through the roof.
Upon closer inspection these bolders appear to be made of a unusual volcanic rock. There is a volcano near by. 

An old man, [[Nervat]], invited the players in and starts packing his things, he is getting out of here along with his family.
He couldn't award the promissed gold for the job completion but offers the tavern in it's place.

The players name their new tavern "On The Rocks".
