Smokey pulls a letter from the board.

A contract courtesy or LootLancer: Carnival in town, Body Guards needed, payment guaranteed.
Smokey grabs some chalk and marks the signature box.

Since last week...

* Alder - Exploring the town and making general improvements.
* Skcorsy - Crafting matching team hats from the fur of his goats.
* Fi - Continuing to watch the shed, she has also seen creatures entering and exiting it.
* Jorm - Pitched a tent against the tavern. Covering the hole in that wall and also making a private space for himself.
* Smokey - Wondered around the town looking for people, hasn't seen many people, the few people Smokey saw he invited to [[On the Rocks]]. Also drinking copious amounts.
* Chaz - Organising a new shipment of red wine. Scaring away eager customers who think the Tavern is open. "We are not ready yet."
* Successful attempts were also made to encourage breeding between goats in the herd. Aiming to stock homemade Baileys.

A knock is heard at the door. Opening it we find a small lady, "Hello Darlings, I'm here for the Security Team, the festival is all setup, we are waiting for you."

The party (plus Bailey the goat) still slowly waking up make a discordant approach to the [[Town Rectangle]] where the Circus has been set up - nearly over night.
The only way into the circus is through a small registration tent, the one the small lady told us to find. Other than that the area is circled by wagons walling off any access.

Outside the Registration Tent two guards stand tall. One with a peculiarly large torso and the other with huge legs.
Noting us as the new bodyguards they send us in.

Inside the Registration Tent there is a small dark room which we are each guided into, one at a time. The dark box is designed to make us each look more like a bodyguard.

Exiting the room we find each other as so...

* Alder - Chest grows (+2 CON)
* Fi - Body Tattoo covering head to feat, plus themed Glasses.
* Skcorsy - Unrulily hair growth, realising this he drops to all four and imitates a goat.
* Bailey (Goat) - Perfect, and unchanged. Given a confetti cannon.
* Chaz - 1 ft shorter but with significantly larger arms (+2 STR). _(For the record, Chaz was 3ft to begin with)_.
* Jorm - Thinner and stretchy (+5ft Reach)

As we enter the fair, we see a number of stalls leading up to the big top, we also noticed that we are the only bodyguards there. Briefed to patrol and test the stalls we head on.

First we visit the Archery Stall, three targets at growing distances.
We insist we are here to test the stall and a few of us have a go. Being unable to hit the final target we leave.
As we leave the man running the stall closes up, the crowd has moved on.

We enter the next stall along, wheel of fortune.
Jorm bets 50 silver pieces and wins returning double his money.
Chaz spins the wheel too but looses Jorms money.

Next we enter a bar busy with people. First investigating the drinking and keg situation. Our attention turns to the centre of the room where there are five bearded dragons racing as well as some betting action. Fi and Alter "motivate" Dragon 3, the slowest dragon. Jorm bets on the most reliable dragon. Chez bets on all dragons. 
Dragon 3 wins shocking the crowd.

Skcorsy is beginning to be suspicious of this carnival and starts looking for things to blow up.

Skcorsy and Chaz look for food trucks, looking for gas canisters that might be susceptible to fire, however none are found.

Suspecting something too Fi disappears off to talk to the DM..

Next the party split between the parkour challenge, strong man challenge and the coconut shy. After testing all of the attractions we enter the big top. 

"Welcome toe the freakshow fight!" the announcer declares as we enter the big top.
Before us we find ten scarecrows.

Instantly Skcorsy attacks the announcer setting the bigtop on fire and probably killing them.
"You want a freak show, we'll give you a freakshow!"

A scarecrow turns and attacks, we fight back.
Identifying five of the scarecrows are harmless we make quick work of the remaining enchanted monsters.
On killing the final scarecrow we step out of the burning big top. Our bodies reset and as we turn around the carnival disappears.
