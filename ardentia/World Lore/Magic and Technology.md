***Magic*** is uncommon in Ardentia.
Discussions and shows of magic fill most of the population with fear and for this reason it has been outlawed.


***Technology*** hasn't really developped in Ardentia. 
There may be a gun or two somewhere in the world but they are prototypes and would more resemble a blunderbus in modern terms.
