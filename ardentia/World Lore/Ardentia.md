The realm of [[Ardentia]] consists of a large disc (complete with edge-of-the-world drop-off and consequent waterfall) resting on the backs of four huge elephants which are in turn standing on the back of an enormous turtle, named [[Great A'Tuin]] (similar to Chukwa or Akupara from Hindu mythology) as it slowly swims through space.
