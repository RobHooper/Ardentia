## 0. Prepare

* Provision a scrap piece of paper, a pen and pencil.
* Print off a new character sheet.

> I recommend this [Character Sheet with a Dyslexic type face](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1buyioIUD6pAOvXiOCrmr_QDu6ksFH5wl)

## 1. Choose a Race

* Note racial traits of your race including
* *Ability modifiers* (Custom Origins? [[Frequently Asked Questions#Custom character origins?]])
* *Movement speed* 
* Known *languages*

## 2. Choose a Class

* Note *class features* (spellcasting) and *proficiencies* (abilities, equipment etc)
* Set character *hit point maximum*, this is equal to the max roll of your hit die.

> We will be rolling for hit points as characters level ([[Frequently Asked Questions#Leveling up and Hit Points]])

## 3. Determine Ability Scores

* We will be rolling for ability scores. Extract from the PHB:

> Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of the highest three dice on a piece of scratch paper. Do this five more times, so that you have six numbers.
> 
> Take your six numbers and write each number beside one of your character’s six abilities (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.) Afterward, make any changes to your ability scores as a result of your race choice.
> 
> To determine an ability modifier, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the result by 2 (round down). Write the modifier next to each of your scores.


## 4. Describe Your Character

* Select a [character background](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/personality-and-background#Backgrounds).
* Determine your characters *bonds* and *flaws*.
* Note *proficiencies* given by your background

> You are an adventurer because you feel a strong call in your bones to adventure. The boredom of a calm life doesn't appeal to you – you are driven to leave behind the safety of civilization and explore the wilds to make your name. Regardless of what drives you, you are driven. You choose where to go and what to do. There will be a handful of obvious choices, but you don't by any means need to take them. The adventure is in your hands.

## 5. Choose Equipment

N.B. Equipment doesn't matter in D&D 5e like it used to, do not waste too much time picking the perfect equipment, it is unlikely to matter once the game has started.


## 6. The Party

* Establish an existing bond to another player in the party.
